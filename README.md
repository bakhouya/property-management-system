# Property Management System

**Property Management System** is a professional project built using **Django REST Framework** to provide a robust platform for property management and services, with a flexible and scalable API for future uses such as web or mobile applications.

## Project Concept
The platform aims to:
- Manage properties completely (CRUD).
- Support user-property interactions (likes, favorites, comments).
- Organize multiple categories (type, main, sub).
- Enable different permissions (Admin/Users) for resource control.
- Ensure secure access and data management.

## Technologies Used
- Python
